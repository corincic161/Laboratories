## What I did
 - **Create an Win32 or WinRT application using C#**

By creating a `Windows Forms Application` project the simplest C# application is created. It is a simple window with 3 basic elements: minimize, maximaze and close. The window can be resized.

  - **Convert a previous laboratory work to C#**

I've decided to rewrite my 1st laboratory work, from C++/Win32 in C#. It was a lot easier because I've used drag and drop feature. The controls that I've used are: Label (for text), MenuStrip (for creating the menu), Button (for pushbuttons), RichTextBox (for textboxes).
In this lab, I modify some functons of the first laboratory, instead of changing the size, I change the colure and a meniu bar.

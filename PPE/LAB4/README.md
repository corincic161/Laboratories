## Contents
* Windows timer

## Mandatory Objectives
* Create an animation based on Windows timer which involves at least 5 different drawn objects

## Objectives With Points
* Increase and decrease animation speed using mouse wheel `(2 pt)`
* Solve flickering problem `(2 pt)` _please describe in your `readme/report` how you did it_
* Add animated objects which interact with each other `(2-6 pt)`, ex.:
  * Few balls which have different velocity and moving angles. In order to get max points, add balls with mouse, make balls to change color on interaction and any other things that will show your engineering spirit
  * Any other interesting and reach in animation application
* Animate a Nyan Cat that leaves a rainbow tail

##How it works?
1.On the bottom of the window the nyan cat runs from left to right and each time it touches the right wall it starts to run again from left to right.

2.Above the nyan cat two Pacmans are running one after another. Each time they touch the wall they change the direction and go up with one level. After passing the 3rd level they go down to the 2nd level and then 1st level and then repeat the process again. Also initially they have orange and blue color but each time one of them eats another one it changes its color to a random one.

3.Above the 3rd level you can add balls which have random colors, appear in random positions and move in different directions. This is done by left clicking.
Also the balls will ricochet from the walls. The bottom wall is considered to be the top of the 3rd level.
 
4.The speed of the animation can be increased or decreased by using the mouse wheel.

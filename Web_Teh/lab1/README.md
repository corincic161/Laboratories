# Laboratory work nr.1 by Sclifos Corina

TODO: 
* Get familiar with various HTML elements and understand how they should be used;
* Understand CSS selectors and specificity;
* Play with Twitter Bootstrap;

## What I did

1. I created a home page which is index.html
2. I created a navbar and some aditionaly pages 

## What I used 

1. HTML to create the structure of the pages.
2. Bootstap, I used online bootstrap by inserting a link in code. It is the same lake the install one with the same packages.

## How I used bootstrap

I don't make more stylesation, I just use classes to create boxes, buttons, navbar etc. Also I used the grid system, home page are separated in 3 equals parts (each have 4 col), the rest pages are the seme separeted in 3 parts but they are not equal (2-8-2 col). I don't created the css file because I don't have so much cod, just some lines and I think it is not necessary to separate file. The pages are responsive, I did this using he following <meta> viewport element in all your web pages.

# Laboratory work nr.2 by Sclifos Corina

TODO: 
* Integrate HTML template from lab#1 into your web application;
* The application should have more that one page(route);

## What I used 

1. To create the demo application, I will first make a project folder on my Desktop, go to that folder, and run rails new rgdemo
2. The MVC architecture

## MVC

* The View provides the interaction that the user sees (typically, a web page). The view components provide data to the user and send actions to the Controller for manipulating data.
* The Model defines the data for the application (typically, the data is stored in a database).
* The controller provides the interface between the View and the Model.
